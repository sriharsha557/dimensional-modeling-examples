# Dimensional Modeling Examples
A comprehensive collection of dimensional modeling examples for data warehousing, featuring star schemas, snowflake schemas, and various industry-specific use cases.
🎯 Purpose
This repository provides practical examples of dimensional modeling techniques used in data warehousing, including:

Star Schema implementations
Snowflake Schema designs
Galaxy Schema patterns
Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) handling
Industry-specific dimensional models

📚 What's Included
Core Concepts

Star Schema: Simple, denormalized approach for optimal query performance
Snowflake Schema: Normalized dimension tables for reduced storage
Galaxy Schema: Multiple fact tables sharing dimension tables
Slowly Changing Dimensions: Handling historical data changes

Industry Examples

Retail: Sales, inventory, customer analytics
Finance: Trading, risk management, regulatory reporting
E-commerce: Web analytics, customer journey, product performance

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server)
Python 3.8+ (for data generation tools)
Git
